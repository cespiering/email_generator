git notes

git fetch v. git pull
multiple branches created
git fetch will grab all recent changes and new branches but will not update what is ucrrently
on screen

git fetch on main, get friend branch 1
git checkout to friend branch 1 and have that branch locally but not update main (maybe have some changeson main
that dont wanna update yet)

git pull does both fetch and pull
auto fetches all branches and updates what is on machine to be in sync with what is on git hub

git branch - can see all of branches that are on local computer
as of 12/17 only 1 branch

to make new branch "git checkout -b smain" (only use -b to create new branch), elsejust enter git checkout s-main

regular "checkout" -- if friend makes branch 1 and pushes to git hub. git fetch will have branch 1 in local file
then use git checkout of branch 1 and now can use and see branch 1 clone--thus can make changes and commits, then push
to github

friend can do same thing. clone branch (proper command will be git fetch/git checkout -b _______(branch name)), make changes, commit and push to github
branch name is like ticket number that is what branch name will be

to switch back to main from other branch, git status will show where you are whats happening with git and what
has not been saved, to return to main git checkout main

"origin" means what is on github, because local computer files can be different from what is on github

git add . == git add --all 

"staged" --> means file is in holding zone until it is commited, can unstage as well
staging is important later, point is making changes but maybe only want to commit one file as opposed to all files
so stage one file, commit, that commit will only save changes from the one file that you have staged and committed
